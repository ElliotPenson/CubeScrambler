CubeScrambler
=============

Generates scrambles (mix ups) for the Rubik's Cube. I hope to one day turn this into a full scrambler/timer.

## Notation

Each move consists of two elements:

1. Side 
    - R (right), L (left), U (up), D (down), F (front), or B (back)
2. Direction
    - *no direction* = 90 degree clockwise turn
    - ' = 90 degree counterclockwise turn
    - 2 = 180 degree turn

For example: R2 means turn the right side 180 degrees and U' means turn the top face 90 degrees counterclockwise.
